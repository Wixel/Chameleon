Chameleon
=========

Collection of CSS selectors that change link colors to the color of the site it's linking to

features :
It's awesome.
Hopefully works on any color background (if not just play around with text-shadow).
Most sites colors (worth linking to) are included.
Awesome hover effect just to add to the awesomeness.
It's fairly easy to implement.
Did I mention it's awesome?

Adding it to your site :
Add the chameleon.css file to your sites folder.
Link to the .css file in your sites header.
Add the class 'color-back' to "body" or the div if the background is a color.
Remember "a:hover" must be after all selectors.
Type a link and see the awesomeness at work.
Remember your manners and thank me (@nicovanzyl actually I would just like your feedback and what you would want to see added to chameleon).
